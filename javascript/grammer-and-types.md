This chapter discusses JavaScript's basic grammar, variable declarations, data types and literals.

Basics
JavaScript borrows most of its syntax from Java, C, and C++, but it has also been influenced by Awk, Perl, and Python.

JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. For example, the word Früh (which means "early" in German) could be used as a variable name.
const Früh = "foobar";
